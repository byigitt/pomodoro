## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a "pomodoro", from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

## How to Use

1. **Set your timer**: Choose between Pomodoro (25 min), Short Break (5 min), or Long Break (15 min)
2. **Start the timer**: Click the Start button to begin the countdown
3. **Focus on your task**: Work until the timer rings
4. **Take a break**: When the Pomodoro timer rings, take a short break
5. **Repeat**: After completing four Pomodoros, take a longer break
